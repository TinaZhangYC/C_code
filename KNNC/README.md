## About KNNC

 K-mer Neighbor Network short read Correction(KNNC)

KNNC is a C program to correct sequencing errors in short-read hight-throughput data
such as those generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer.


## System Requirements

KNNC has been tested on systems running Linux on an x86_64 architecture.
Compiling the program requires GCC v4.4.6 or greater.


## Installation

KNNC [options] infile

	Options:
		-k	the length of k-mer
		-e	the frequency of k-mers to be corrected eg: 1
		-s	the solid k-mer threshold weight: Q1/hfreq [1,2....]
		-r	refilter weight:(refilter/100)*(readLen-k+1) [1...100] (>r: discard)
		-h	for this help


## Example

KNNC -k 25 -l 1 -h 1 -a 100 -d 100 -f 10 -r 7 SRR292678.flt.fa >SRR292678.flt.log 2>>SRR292678.flt.log
